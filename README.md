#Instuctions to start your project!!!

1. Navigate to the `Challenges` folder or any other folder that you want to create your project from.

2. Create a new folder with the `project name` in that directory.

3. Within the same directory copy your starter files into that new project folder by entering in the following command:
   `cp -R 1.Gulp-html-css-starter/ New-project-name/`
   This will copy all of the contents of the `"1.Gulp-html-css-starter"` files into the `new project folder`.

4. CD into the `new project folder` and open that folder in VS code.

5. Once in VS code initilize git with `git init` command.

6. Create a `.gitignore` file. Enter node_modules so that git ignores these files.

8. Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.

9. `git status` and then `git add .` and then `git commit -m "message"` to initialize your first commit and clean your working tree.

10. Go to Github.com and create and new repository with the project name.

`git remote add origin https://github.com/jledesma44/name-of-repo`
`git branch -M master`
`git push -u origin master`
